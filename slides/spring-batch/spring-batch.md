# spring-batch  
provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including    
`logging/tracing`, `transaction management`, `job processing statistics`, `job restart`, `skip`, and `resource management`.     
It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques.     
Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.    

- Transaction management
- Chunk based processing
- Declarative I/O
- Start/Stop/Restart
- Retry/Skip
- Web based administration interface ([Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow))
