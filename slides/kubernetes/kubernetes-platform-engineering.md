**Challenges of Managing Diverse Applications**    
In an environment with diverse applications and services, achieving standardization can be elusive. `Platform engineers` need to strike a balance between accommodating these unique requirements and establishing standardized processes that ensure consistency and manageability.    

**A Paradigm Shift in Platform Engineering**        
Kubernetes embodies the principles of high availability and fault tolerance, critical aspects of platform engineering. `Platform engineers` can architect systems that maintain continuous service even in the face of unforeseen challenges.    

The daunting task of updating applications while minimizing downtime and compatibility hiccups finds a streamlined approach in Kubernetes. `platform engineers` can orchestrate updates that are seamless, incremental, and reversible.

**Understanding Multitenancy**    
- Resource Isolation: Namespaces provide an isolated space where resources such as pods, services, and configurations are contained.    
- Security and Access Control: Namespaces allow `platform engineers` to set Role-Based Access Control rules specific to each Namespace.    
- Naming Scope: Namespaces ensure naming uniqueness across different teams or projects.     
- Logical Partitioning: Platform engineers can logically partition applications.    

**Kubernetes Controllers: The Automation Engine**    
- Scaling: HPA automatically adjusts the pod replicas on observed CPU or custom metrics.
- Self-Healing: Liveness and readiness probes contribute to application self-healing. 
- Updating: Kubernetes controllers, automate application updates.
