# wiremock   

> WireMock supports several approaches for creating mock APIs - in code, via its REST API, as JSON files and by recording HTTP traffic proxied to another destination. WireMock has a rich matching system, allowing any part of an incoming request to be matched against complex and precise criteria. Responses of any complexity can be dynamically generated via the Handlebars based templating system. Finally, WireMock is easy to integrate into any workflow due to its numerous extension points and comprehensive APIs.    

> Key features     

- HTTP response stubbing, matchable on URL, header and body content patterns
- Request verification
- Runs in unit tests, as a standalone process or as a WAR app
- Record/playback of stubs
- Configurable response delays and Fault injection
- Per-request conditional proxying
- Browser proxying for request inspection and replacement
- Stateful behaviour simulation
